Run
```
$ sudo apt-get install ipython python-dev gfortran libatlas-base-dev build-essential
```

Then
$ sudo apt-get build-dep python-numpy
$ ./install.sh

Disclaimer: I do not know exactly what I did to get this all working... But, the above commands and the `requirements.txt` file should hopefully help.
