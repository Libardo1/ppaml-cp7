Step by step to produce the the JSON file that contains weekly
vaccination rates and tweet counts for each county, as well as other
county demographic information.  The instruction briefly summarizes
the corresponding python file used at each step and its procedure.

Step 1.
Combine data from US_Census and Flu_Vaccination into a dictionary
and store in a JSON-formated file:

./software/data/combineData.py


Step 2.
Extract relevant meta data from the Tweets
(1) Load Twitter data in Gnip's Activity Streams format
(2) Divide the data according to the time frame of interest
(3) Save relevant data in a Python Pickle file

./software/data/Twitter/loadTweets.py


Step 3.

Given latitude and longitude (from the pickle file generated by
loadTweet.py in Step 2) of each tweet location, find the corresponding county.
(1) read the meta data of tweets stored in a dictionary
(2) query FCC site to convert lat/lon to county
(3) save the data in a dictionary (same key as the tweet
    meta data) in a Python Pickle file

./software/data/Twitter/reverseGeoCode.py


Step 4.
Augment county information (from the JSON file generated by
combineData.py in Step 1) with tweet counts from Step 3.

(1) Load tweet meta data and corresponding counties
(2) Load county information
(3) Count weekly number of tweets in each county
(4) Augment the weekly vaccination data with the tweet counts
(5) Save the augmented data with the demographics and vacination data
    in the previously created JSON file

./software/data/Twitter/aggregateTweetCount
